mattdavis777: on 5th day of 7 days, i want an email sent out saying you have [7-5] days left


Kyle: i see


mattdavis777: and you have Y referral counts left until your next product level


Kyle: i understand
i can do this also in prelauncher site


mattdavis777: ok cool


Kyle: so if someone has reached to level-5, no need to send the email.
right?
level-5 means 50 referrals


mattdavis777: what will the email be pertaining too? how much time left?


Kyle: what do you mean?


mattdavis777: a level 5 email will say "Congratulations you made it to 50 referrals!"


Kyle: okay


mattdavis777: and on "day 5" if they already have 50 referrals...we need one that says "We know that you've already maxed out, but please keep referring friends"


Kyle: i understand
i have just asked that email.
and i have one question
this prelauncher site is only need one time?
for one week
?


mattdavis777: it will be for 1 week only and then go away


Kyle: oh i see


mattdavis777: and we will want to implement it in about 6 months down the road for 1 week too
we want to make this a "sharing event" that people become excited about twice a year


Kyle: i understand
maybe i can implement "day 5" feature on tommorrow.
is it ok?
