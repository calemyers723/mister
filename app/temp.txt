mattdavis777: on 5th day of 7 days, i want an email sent out saying you have [7-5] days left


Kyle: i see


mattdavis777: and you have Y referral counts left until your next product level


Kyle: i understand
i can do this also in prelauncher site


mattdavis777: ok cool


Kyle: so if someone has reached to level-5, no need to send the email.
right?
level-5 means 50 referrals


mattdavis777: what will the email be pertaining too? how much time left?


Kyle: what do you mean?


mattdavis777: a level 5 email will say "Congratulations you made it to 50 referrals!"


Kyle: okay


mattdavis777: and on "day 5" if they already have 50 referrals...we need one that says "We know that you've already maxed out, but please keep referring friends"


Kyle: i understand
i have just asked that email.
and i have one question
this prelauncher site is only need one time?
for one week
?


mattdavis777: it will be for 1 week only and then go away


Kyle: oh i see


mattdavis777: and we will want to implement it in about 6 months down the road for 1 week too
we want to make this a "sharing event" that people become excited about twice a year


Kyle: i understand
maybe i can implement "day 5" feature on tommorrow.
is it ok?

Hi Nick
Thank you for your reply.

1) Will you be able to implement this rails app on a shopify site?
Actually, it's impossible to integrate this prelaunchr rails source code into shopify site.
But I have a solution how to integrate this rails app into shopify site.
I have just done to integrate this app into shopify site.
2) What will you need to get started (psd, image assets, etc)?
If you send me the graphic design files (psd is good), I can start immediately
3) If all necessary assets are provided to you, will your budget include a fully functional and operation prelaunch site?
I would like to know the fully functional and operation what you want.
4) Will it be responsive?
Yes, I can.
But for all your requirements, I need some extra budget.
